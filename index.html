        <p>The factorial of a number is denoted as <i>n!</i></p>
        <p>It is calculated by <i>n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1</i></p>
        <p>A common use case for factorials is to calculate arrangements and possibilities. Say, for example, you have a standard deck of 52 cards and you wanted to know the amount of unique ways you can arrange them. The answer would be the factorial of
            52, or <i>52!</i> (which is an indredibly large number ðŸ˜µ).</p>
        <p>Enter a number below to calculate its factorial</p>
        <input type="text" name="factorial_input" placeholder="Enter a number">
        <div class="button" onclick="factorial()">Give me the factorial</div>
        <div class="button calculateFactorial">Let's see the factorial</div>
        <p>Output:
            <div class="factorialOutput"></div>
            <div class="workShown"></div>
